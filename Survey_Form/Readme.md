## DESCRIPTION

I've created a basic Survey Form using HTML, CSS.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. In the `h1` tag I've used `id="title"` for displaying the title.
2. In the `p` tag I've used `id="description"` for a short explanation.
3. In the `form` tag I've used `id="survey-form"`.
4. Inside the form element I've used the following id attributes:
   * `id="name"` to enter the name.
   * `id="email"` to enter the email. If the entered email is not formatted correctly. There will'be an HTML5 validation error.
   * `id="number"` to enter the age. If someone enters non-numbers in the number input, there will'be an HTML5 validation error.
5. For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form there is corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: `id="name-label"`, `id="email-label"` and `id="number-label"`.
6. Inside the form element, there is an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding `id="dropdown"`.
7. Inside the form element, I've used a `name` attribute.
8. Inside the form element, I've used a `value` attribute, through which we can select several fields from a series of checkboxes.
9. Inside the form element there is  a button with `id="submit"` to submit all the inputs.
