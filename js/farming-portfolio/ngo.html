        <p>Haritika is an organization started with the aim of working on sustainable projects related to water harvesting and management, crop optimization, soil conservation, and afforestation. Their ‘Horticulture Wadi Development program’ works to help farmers in India struggling with extreme poverty, illiteracy and lack of healthcare. They ensure that farmers can support their families by providing them with seeds, saplings, pesticides, and other supplies. The necessary agricultural products are handed to farmers between March and October. Donate now and support poor farmers with saplings</p></div>

       <h2 class="md-head">Manuvikasa</h2>
        <p>Manuvikasa is working to help farmers in India by building at least four water tanks in every village. The locations of the tanks are decided by the farmers with the assistance of local water experts. The structures are designed to last for at least 10 years with no maintenance. Poor and needy farmers are selected to work on the project with the NGO. They are trying to support farming communities to improve agriculture income through SRI cultivation. Donating to this program will help villagers get access to a harvesting pond. </p></div>

        <h3 class="md-head">Bhagini Nivedita Gramin Vigyan Niketan (BNGVN)</h3>

    <p>Several talukas in Jalgaon, which used to be famous for its banana cultivation, have now become drought-prone. With a population highly dependent on agriculture, the situation is very bleak and BNGVN is working to change this situation. Through deepening and widening of streams, well refilling, tree plantation and several other conservation efforts, the NGO hopes to increase the underground water level and help these farmers overcome their water shortage. You can donate to this NGO to help Indian farmers fight drought-like conditions and save their crops.</p>
