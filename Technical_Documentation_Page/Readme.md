## DESCRIPTION

I've created a Technical Documentation Page made by using HTML, CSS.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

1. I've used a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

2. Within the `#main-doc` element, there are several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`.

3. The first element within each `.main-section` is a `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

4. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` have an id that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. 

5. I've used a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.

6. In the navbar element I've used one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

7. The navbar contains link elements with the class of `nav-link`. There is one for every element with the class `main-section`.

8. Each element with the class of `nav-link` contains a text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section`.

9. By clicking on a navbar element, the page navigate to the corresponding section of the `main-doc` element.

10. The elements with `id="navbar"` is hown on the left side of the screen.
