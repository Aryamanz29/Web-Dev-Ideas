##SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1.There is a header in my page with id="header".
2. Inside header there are 3 links to content inside page of class nav-link.
3.There is a form with id="form" in which user is asked to enter their email.
4.There is a section with id="features" that consists of all the features of our product and can be navigated to using the "Features" option in header.
5. There is a tutorial video that can be navigated to by clicking "How it works".
6.Below video there are prices listed of our product under the class="grid-2" which can be navigated to using the link "Pricing" in nav-bar.
